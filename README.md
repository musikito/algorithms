JavaScript and Python Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains JavaScript based examples of many popular algorithms and data structures.

Each algorithm and data structure eventually will have its own separate README with related explanations and links for further reading.

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
